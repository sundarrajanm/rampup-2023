# rampup-2023
A studying material repo towards using a vuejs UI + Golang API + k8s platform.

# Goal 

As a 2023 ramp up activity, the following shall be accomplished:
* Build a representative application that involves RESTful APIs, Security and Testablity
  aspects covered.
* Configure and enable necessary telemetry aspects from monitoring & alerting perspective.
* Build a representative UI application using Vue.js that will consume these APIs with
  testablity & telemetry (like clickstream, errors reporting etc) aspects covered.
* Demonstrate a simple CI/CD pipepline for the ecosystem that promotes everyday or more
  frequent deployments ensuring engineering efficiency is measured through DORA metrics.
* Apply machine learning algorithms in the ecosystem to demonstrate an automation aspect
  that is evolving dynamically without human intervention.
